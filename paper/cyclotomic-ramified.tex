We try to attack prime cyclotomics when the modulus $q$ is
equal to the prime $p$.

\section{Intro} Let $p$ be an odd prime and $K = \bQ(\zeta_p)$. First we deal with the case of sampling. A result of [DD] says that sampling from the Minkowski space of $K$ with paremeter $\sigma$ is the same as sampling a Discrete Gaussian from the quotient ring
\[
    \bZ[x]/(x^p-1)
\]
with parameter $\sigma/\sqrt{p}$. We are going to take this point of view. The determinant factor is
$$Disc(K)^{\frac{1}{2[K:\bQ]}} = p^{\frac{p-2}{2(p-1)}}.$$

Suppose we have chosen a base parameter $\sigma_0$. Then the adjustment $\sigma = \sigma_0/\sqrt{p} \cdot p^{\frac{p-2}{2(p-1)}} = \sigma_0 \cdot p^{\frac{-1}{2p-2}}$. Hence a general error term is
\[
    e = e_0 + e_1 \zeta_p + \cdots + e_{p-1} \zeta_{p-1}
\]
where $(e_i)_i$ are sampled from $D_{\bZ^n, \sigma}$, and then reduced modulo $p$. Note that every $\zeta_p$ maps to 1 in $\bF_p$. Hence we have
\[
    e(1) = e_0 + e_1 + \cdots +e_{p-1} \in \bF_p.
\]
Now we use the {\bf independence} of the samples to conclude that $e_0 + e_1 + \cdots +e_{p-1} \sim D_{\bZ,\sqrt{p}\sigma}$, and assume that $|e(1)| \leq \sqrt{p}\sigma$.

Now for [ELOS] attack to work, we need
\[
    |e(1)| \leq p/4,
\]
and we computed $p/|e(1)| \geq \sqrt{p}/\sigma_0$. So when $p$ is not to small, this attack will work.
